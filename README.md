# Save a playlist

Saveaplaylist.com allows you to take a snapshot of Spotify playlists so that it
persists through playlist updates.

## Background

Spotify does not allow you to save a playlist without being subject to
playlist updates. In addition, the ability to go back in time and
view/listen to prior versions of a playlist does not exist.

Some playlists are perfect the way they are, and updates are
unwelcome.

## How it works

It's simple. We use the Spotify API to:

1. Search for existing playlists.
2. Create a new playlist in your account, owned by you.
3. Add each song from the playlist you want to save to your new playlist.
