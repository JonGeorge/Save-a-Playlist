# Save a playlist

[Saveaplaylist.com](https://saveaplaylist.com) allows you to take a snapshot of 
Spotify playlists.

## Background

Many Spotify users have expressed interest in the ability 
to opt-out of playlist updates, however, [this is not a feature Spotify 
offers.](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/save-recover-playlists/) 
What does this mean? A playlist you've had on repeat for the last 
two weeks can be changed at any time at the discretion of the playlist owner. 
Sometimes having songs removed from or added to a playlist is refreshing; or 
a change in the order of your playlists' songs is welcomed. For the times when 
those changes are not welcomed, you can use saveaplaylist.com to capture the 
current state of a playlist for future enjoyment.

Some playlists are perfect the way they are!

## How it works

It's simple. We use the Spotify API to:

1. Search for existing playlists.
2. Create a new playlist in your account, owned by you.
3. Add each song from the playlist you want to save to your new playlist.

These steps are [Spotify's recommended method](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/save-recover-playlists/) to save a playlist, we've just 
automated it. ðŸ¤“
